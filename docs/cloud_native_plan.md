# Cloud Native Migration Plan

## Philosophy: A Phased Approach

We will adopt a **"Crawl, Walk, Run"** phased approach to cloud migration. The goal is to start simple and introduce complexity only when necessary, avoiding premature optimization while building a solid foundation for future scalability.

This plan ensures that we can deploy and get value from the project early on, while having a clear roadmap for growth.

## Phase 1: Containerization (The "Crawl" Phase)

The first and most crucial step towards cloud-readiness is to containerize our application components using **Docker**. This makes our application portable and our deployment process consistent across all environments.

- **`Dockerfile`**: Each microservice in the `/services` directory (e.g., `auth-service`) will have its own `Dockerfile`. This file will define the exact steps to build a portable, self-contained image of the service, including its Python environment and dependencies.

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: A `docker-compose.yml` file will be created in the project root to orchestrate the entire local development environment. It will define how to:
  - Build and run containers for each of our services (`auth-service`, `expense-service`, etc.).
  - Spin up a container for our MongoDB database.
  - (In the future) Add other backing services like Redis if needed.

- **Goal**: To be able to run the entire Constellation ecosystem, including its database, with a single command: `docker-compose up`. This perfectly replicates a production-like environment on any local machine.

## Phase 2: Cloud Deployment & Managed Services (The "Walk" Phase)

Once containerized, we can easily deploy our application to a cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure). In this phase, we prioritize simplicity and low maintenance.

- **Compute**: Instead of managing our own virtual machines, we will deploy our containers to a **serverless container platform** like **Google Cloud Run** or **AWS App Runner**.
  - **Why?**: These platforms offer incredible benefits for a project of our scale: pay-per-use (even scaling to zero when there's no traffic, which is very cost-effective), automatic scaling to handle load spikes, and simplified deployment directly from a container image.

- **Database**: We will migrate from a Dockerized MongoDB to a fully **managed database service** like **MongoDB Atlas**.
  - **Why?**: This offloads critical but tedious tasks like database setup, backups, point-in-time recovery, security patching, and scaling to the cloud provider. We can focus on building features, not managing databases.

- **Secrets Management**: We will use a dedicated secret manager (e.g., Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and inject sensitive information like database passwords and JWT secret keys into our running containers, instead of using `.env` files in production.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Cloud-Native (The "Run" Phase)

As the system grows in complexity, number of services, and user traffic, we can evolve to a more powerful, industry-standard cloud-native stack.

- **Orchestration**: If our services become numerous and require complex networking or scaling policies, we will consider migrating the entire application stack to **Kubernetes (K8s)**. We will use a managed K8s service like **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** or **Amazon EKS**.
  - **Benefit**: This provides the ultimate level of control, resilience, and scalability for a large microservices application.

- **API Gateway**: We will introduce a dedicated API Gateway (e.g., Kong, or cloud provider solutions like Google Cloud API Gateway) to act as the single, intelligent entry point for all incoming traffic.
  - **Responsibilities**: It will handle request routing, SSL termination, rate limiting, and can even offload tasks like JWT validation from the individual services.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A full Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline will be established using tools like **GitHub Actions**.
  - **Workflow**: On every push to the `main` branch, tests will be automatically run. On success, Docker images will be built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Google Artifact Registry), followed by an automatic, zero-downtime deployment to our Kubernetes or Cloud Run environment.
